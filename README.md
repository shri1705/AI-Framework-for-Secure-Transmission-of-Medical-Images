"AI-Driven Framework for Secure Transmission of Medical Images" focuses on enhancing the privacy and security of medical image data using a novel
deep learning approach called DeepKeyGen. This framework employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate highly random and
secure private keys for encrypting medical images. The encryption process ensures that sensitive patient information in medical images is protected
from unauthorized access and tampering during transmission.
